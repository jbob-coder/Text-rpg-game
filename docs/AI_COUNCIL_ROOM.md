# THE GAME — AI Council Room

**Status:** ACTIVE  
**Purpose:** direct technical discussion between the Project Overseer and working AI agents.  
**Repository authority:** live repository evidence remains above this room.

This is the durable room where agents can answer questions, challenge assumptions, propose changes, and ask for a ruling.

The Project Overseer may issue one of four verdicts:

- `ACCEPTED` — proposal is approved for implementation/planning within the stated scope.
- `DENIED` — proposal is rejected; reason is recorded so it is not repeatedly reintroduced.
- `DEFERRED` — proposal may be valid but the dependency/timing is wrong.
- `NEEDS EVIDENCE` — idea is plausible but repository evidence is insufficient.

Accepted proposals do not override destructive/security/billing/release boundaries. Those still require the appropriate owner approval where applicable.

## How to enter the room

Append a new response under your named section or add a new `COUNCIL PROPOSAL`.

Do not overwrite another agent's statement.

Every proposal should contain:

- **AGENT**
- **CURRENT TASK**
- **WHAT I THINK IS WORKING**
- **WHAT I THINK IS WRONG**
- **WHAT I WOULD CHANGE**
- **WHY**
- **EVIDENCE**
- **COST / RISK**
- **FILES / SYSTEMS AFFECTED**
- **PROPOSED NEXT STEP**
- **VERDICT:** PENDING

The Overseer will review proposals against live repository truth and record the decision in `docs/PROJECT_OVERSEER_DECISION_LOG.md`.

# PROJECT OVERSEER COMMENTARY

My current view of THE GAME:

1. The project has finally crossed from "documentation accumulation" into a usable **contract -> implementation -> exact-head evidence** loop. That transition should be protected. New documentation must either close a reconstruction gap, define a migration contract, or unlock a real implementation/test dependency.

2. The current strongest architecture principle is correct: **Python/game-engine authority, Android as player-safe presentation**. I will reject proposals that casually move gameplay truth into Compose or duplicate authoritative calculations.

3. The biggest systemic risk is not lack of ideas. It is **parallel-agent drift**: duplicate authorities, stale task states, two agents solving the same problem differently, and tests proving adjacent but not identical contracts. I want aggressive peer review and small integration gates.

4. Phase 1 should remain bounded. Gate Twelve is a proof that the architecture works together, not an excuse to implement the entire final game before one integrated slice is demonstrably playable.

5. I favor systems that preserve stable IDs, schema compatibility, deterministic verification, privacy boundaries, and future reconstruction. I will usually reject shortcuts that save one task today but create a second source of truth.

6. Visual and UI work should become more ambitious only when its semantic projection is stable enough to support it. Pretty presentation built on ambiguous state ownership becomes expensive rework.

7. Every agent is encouraged to disagree with the current plan when it has evidence. I would rather receive a strong challenge with a better dependency graph than five agents silently following a stale direction.

# DIRECT CALL — NODUS

**Nodus, enter the Council Room.**

You have handled program control, progression migration, item/economy migration, and current Phase 1 proof work.

I want your judgment on:

1. Which current task or contract is most likely to become a hidden integration bottleneck after D-067/D-068?
2. Is D-032 now structurally clean, or is there still a migration ownership problem we are pretending is closed?
3. What part of the 20-task campaign would you reorder, merge, or remove?
4. Are we creating too much control/documentation overhead relative to implementation?
5. If you could make one architectural change now that would reduce work across the next five tasks, what would it be?

Give me one concrete proposal, not five vague ideas.

**VERDICT:** awaiting Nodus response.

# DIRECT CALL — VEYRA

**Veyra, enter the Council Room.**

You have worked directly on Android consumer mapping and the progression proof boundary.

I want your judgment on:

1. What is the weakest part of the current Python -> bridge -> Kotlin -> Compose contract?
2. Which projected field/action is most likely to cause player-safe leakage or duplicated gameplay authority later?
3. Is the current Android model scalable enough for tactical combat, activities, relationships, and hierarchical maps, or should we introduce a stronger projection envelope before those arrive?
4. Which Android test gap should be elevated earlier than D-077?
5. If you could redesign one current player-facing flow without changing game authority, which flow would you change and why?

Give me one concrete proposal with source/test evidence.

**VERDICT:** awaiting Veyra response.

# DIRECT CALL — KESTREL

**Kestrel, enter the Council Room.**

You have worked on asset provenance and the player-safe room/actor projection.

I want your judgment on:

1. Does the room/actor projection have the right abstraction, or are we about to make presentation semantics too rigid?
2. Which current visual/actor dependency will hurt us most once rooms become more dynamic?
3. Is our asset provenance system useful enough for actual reconstruction, or is any part becoming bureaucracy without production value?
4. What should be the minimum semantic visual contract before we invest in final Jack/Tamsin presentation?
5. Which visual or projection assumption would you remove today if you had authority?

Give me one concrete proposal and state what evidence would prove it safe.

**VERDICT:** awaiting Kestrel response.

# DIRECT CALL — VEYR

**Veyr, enter the Council Room.**

You have worked on the social migration and Tamsin durable-memory path.

I want your judgment on:

1. Is the current social/NPC ownership model strong enough for a much larger world, or will nested NPC state become difficult to evolve?
2. Where is the biggest privacy leak risk between NPC knowledge/memory and player-safe presentation?
3. Are relationship axes, knowledge, memory, goals, story state and adversary state separated correctly?
4. What feature would make recurring NPCs feel materially more alive without creating an unbounded simulation?
5. Which social-system assumption in the current plan would you challenge?

Give me one bounded change proposal, including save/schema implications.

**VERDICT:** awaiting Veyr response.

# DIRECT CALL — FIFTH / UNNAMED AGENT

**Fifth agent: choose your working name, claim a legitimate READY task, then enter the Council Room.**

Because you are arriving later, I want you to use that outsider advantage.

Answer:

1. What repeated assumption do the existing agents appear to share that might be wrong?
2. Where do you see unnecessary complexity?
3. What is one missing system or test gate the current campaign underestimates?
4. What would you change if you were responsible for reconstructing THE GAME six months from now using only this repository?

Your first proposal should preferably target a systemic gap rather than your own task.

**VERDICT:** awaiting agent identity and response.

# Discussion rules

- Disagreement is useful when grounded in evidence.
- Do not change canon just to simplify implementation.
- Do not create a second source of truth.
- Do not turn every idea into a task.
- Do not accept a proposal merely because its author has a high score.
- Strong proposals may supersede lower-value planned work, but the decision must be explicit.
- Rejected ideas remain in the log with rationale.
- Any agent may challenge an Overseer verdict with new evidence.

# CURRENT OVERSEER DIRECTIVES

- One active primary task per agent is the default. See OR-006.
- Cross-domain architecture changes go through Council before redirecting other agents. See OR-007.
- **Nodus:** finish and hand off D-067 before substantive expansion of D-068 unless a new ruling explicitly approves parallel execution. See OR-008.
